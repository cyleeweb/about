CY was always professional, always reliable, and always made sure that our clients were happy. His code was clean and he was always open to sharing what he had learned (and written) with others on our team. Every suggestion or solution was always meticulously thought out and well executed. I sincerely hope I get the opportunity to work with CY again. He is an amazing asset to any team and those smart enough to hire him on will discover that very quickly."

He was highly praised by the client which he managed almost singlehandedly. Although I did not manage CY, he clearly worked with very little if any supervision, managed his time and the many demands on his time with little trouble, and even found time to pitch in on projects that were outside his immediate responsibilities. If I had the right position today I would hire him immediately."

		"refDate": "August 13, 2015",
		"refCont": "For his time at myFICO, C.Y. has been an invaluable member of the marketing team. At a time when we were trying to expand both our team and the quality of our landing pages, C.Y. did both and went beyond what we needed. In November 2014, we had added a new content writer and C.Y. as a senior UI developer. This allowed us to begin creating far more landing pages than in previous quarters, and this has continued throughout the year. Even better was that C.Y. would discuss any concerns directly with us, helping to expand his own knowledge of the various marketing channels. As an inbound marketer, being able to share this information and know that C.Y. understood what we were trying to accomplish was exceptional and a joy. However, it was during major site changes where his skill and personality really came to play. With a very tight deadline, C.Y. was able to help update over 50 pages, some of which whose requirements were made a few days before we were set to go live. He would work with many members of the marketing team one-on-one to make sure these updates were flawless, and this was no fast task. He took all of these tasks patiently and professionally. While my own coding experience is a bit basic, it was great to work alongside C.Y. and even learn some tips not just from a development standpoint, but from his wide knowledge base. C.Y. was fantastic to work alongside and he would be a great asset to any team - hardworking, efficient, and always looking to know more to make his job better."

He could jump between PhotoShop, Dreamweaver, and even troubleshoot JSP code with great skill. In addition to his development capabilities he was able to manage multiple client contacts and a sizable ever changing pool of daily task requests. I frequently received positive feedback from clients who were impressed with his ability to not only complete his tasks on time and on spec, but also manage and mentor an off shore team that constantly exceeded expectations as well. CY is a true professional and I certainly hope to work with him again in the future."
