Using Sass

Sass can be used in three ways: as a command-line tool, as a standalone Ruby module, and as a plugin for any Rack-enabled framework, including Ruby on Rails and Merb. The first step for all of these is to install the Sass gem:

gem install sass
If you’re using Windows, you may need to install Ruby first.

To run Sass from the command line, just use
sass input.scss output.css

You can also tell Sass to watch the file and update the CSS every time the Sass file changes:
sass --watch input.scss:output.css

If you have a directory with many Sass files, you can also tell Sass to watch the entire directory:
sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets

Use sass --help for full documentation.

Using Sass in Ruby code is very simple. After installing the Sass gem, you can use it by running require "sass" and using Sass::Engine like so:
engine = Sass::Engine.new("#main {background-color: #0000ff}", :syntax => :scss)
engine.render #=> "#main { background-color: #0000ff; }\n"
