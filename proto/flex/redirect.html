IN CASE nothing can be done at the serverside at this point, do this at the clientside:

1. Create the 'community' folder under sevicenow.com's root.
2. Use legacyHTML component, add the 'index.html' file as the default page under the 'comminity' folder (believing index.html is configured in the default order)
3. Add the following script snippet into the page. 

<Script>
	window.location = "https://community.servicenow.com/";
</Script>

3. Publish it.
